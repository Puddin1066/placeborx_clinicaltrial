✅ **Digital Interventions**: Digital therapeutic trials identified
✅ **Results Available**: Trials with published results found

## Recommendations
1. **Focus on Market Validation**: Given limited OLP clinical evidence, prioritize market demand validation
2. **Digital Therapeutic Approach**: Consider positioning as digital therapeutic rather than traditional placebo
3. **Pilot Study Design**: Design small-scale efficacy studies to generate initial clinical data
4. **Regulatory Strategy**: Consult on digital therapeutic classification and regulatory pathway
