12345678,Open-label placebo treatment in chronic pain: A randomized controlled trial,Pain Medicine,2023,Smith J; Johnson A; Brown K,Placebo Effect; Chronic Pain; Open-label,0.95,0.35,0.001,This study demonstrates that open-label placebo treatment can significantly reduce chronic pain symptoms. Patients were informed they were receiving placebo yet still showed 30% improvement in pain scores.
12345679,Digital placebo interventions: A systematic review of mobile health applications,Digital Health,2023,Davis M; Wilson R,Digital Health; Placebo Effect; Mobile Applications,0.92,0.42,0.002,Systematic review of 15 studies examining digital placebo interventions. Results show that app-based placebo treatments can enhance traditional placebo effects by 25-40%.
12345680,Honest placebo for anxiety disorders: Clinical outcomes and mechanisms,Journal of Anxiety Disorders,2022,Garcia L; Martinez P,Anxiety Disorders; Placebo Effect; Honest Placebo,0.88,0.38,0.003,Randomized trial comparing honest placebo to treatment-as-usual in anxiety disorders. Honest placebo group showed 35% reduction in anxiety symptoms.
12345681,Expectation and conditioning in digital placebo responses,Psychopharmacology,2023,Taylor S; Anderson B,Placebo Effect; Conditioning; Digital Interface,0.85,0.28,0.01,Mechanistic study examining how digital interfaces can enhance placebo responses through expectation and conditioning mechanisms.
