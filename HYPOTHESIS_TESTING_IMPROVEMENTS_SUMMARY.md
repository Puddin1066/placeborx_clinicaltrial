## Overview

This document summarizes the significant enhancements made to the PlaceboRx validation pipeline to enable more thorough and rigorous hypothesis testing. These improvements transform the basic validation tool into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade analytics platform that provides deeper insights, better data quality, and more actionable recommendations.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Problem Addressed**

**Original Question**: "Can the repo be improved with controls or further data enhancement?"

**Solution Implemented**: A comprehensive enhancement framework that addresses:
- Statistical rigor in hypothesis testing
- Experimental design optimization for future studies
- Real-world evidence collection and analysis

**Key Features**:
- **6 Core Hypotheses Tested**:
  - Digital placebo efficacy (meta-analysis approach)
  - Market demand existence (statistical significance testing)
  - Condition specificity (non-parametric ANOVA)
  - Dose-response relationships (correlation analysis)
  - Temporal effect sustainability (longitudinal analysis)
  - Demographic generalizability (consistency testing)

- **Advanced Statistical Methods**:
  - Meta-analysis with heterogeneity assessment
  - Power analysis and sample size calculations
  - Effect size calculations (Cohen's d, eta-squared)
